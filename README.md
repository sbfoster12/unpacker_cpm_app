# unpacker_cpm_app

This is a repository to test using the unpacker (https://github.com/sbfoster12/unpacker) library with CPM (https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/tree/v0.42.0).

You can build the project with `sh build.sh`.

Once built, you can use the unpacker (see the unpacker's README) or run a test executable, which will be installed in `bin`. For the test executable, in the `bin` directory, run it with `./my_app`
